	<h1>Home To The Studio Depths Team</h1>
		<p><strong>Welcome to the city that never sleeps...literally it doesn't.</strong> Aside from that, this is the page for anything Studio Depths related, updates the the Video games in idea that we have and new skills that we as a Dev Team may have learned along our long way towards success.
            <p>Our Dev Team branches from Massachusetts to right here in Brooklyn New York and do plan in the future to branch to florida and california in order to find likeminded trusted people from this career path that would want to join us on this long journey.  </p>
			<h1>We're up to something special</h1>
			<p>all of us have something we're up to, all have plans, dreams and goals. i work as the website manager, the creative drector and Business manager for disisions and finance. others in the Dev team are working on different code language, engineering and business... all working together to make something big.  </p>
			<p class="pull-quote">“Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced.” - James Baldwin</p>
			<P>You don't know until you try, people hear it a lot and are like whatever but that saying in undoubtingly true. if you don't face things, how would you ever change anything; we as a team face change with our heads up to get to our life goals as video game devs and went be scared to do it again if we had to, we chosen this dream since a young age (age four for me) and never lost sight on our path.</P>
