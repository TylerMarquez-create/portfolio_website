	  </a><h2>The Long journey</h2>
	  <p>I came a long way with my skills in photoshop/illustrator and done a lot of other stuff to get to where i am now, filming, editing and ect. </p>
	  <p>i made films for example, the fake it film, the war film, and the summer child film were all films i made over time throughout my time learning these skills. from high school to college, i worked hard to make what i need to do; well happen. all to make it to my goal to be a Game Developer/designer and make Studio Depths a future up and coming Video Game company with a Dev Team to be proud of.</p>
