          economy/ecommerce, game art, game development and design. it may be a lot for one person however, i'm not
          the only person going in these fields; there's others in Studio Depths that are activly studying in these
          fields. As CEO, I'm here to see that our hardwork and creative ambitions weren't all for nothing.</p>

        <p class="pull-quote">“Sacrifice Death, Depths Curse” - Depths curse</p>

        <p>This quote is the foundation of this Company as a whole, its this was the first quote to a the first video
          game idea i've ever made. the origin of the quote was comes from late November of 2019 when i thought to
          myself why i never typed any of my ideas i had when i was young even when i was told many times that id be
          good to at least have it down and at that moment; i went into my notes and started typing down the draft
          ideas for a game known as Depths Curse...my first game idea and even now; i work on it along this other
          ideas to improve its story and plot.</p>


        <h2>Our insprations as Studio Depths</h2>

        <p>As a group, we've always loved to aspect of Gothic Themes and setings as most of the games we loved the
          most had be made with plot and theme aspects that the American Gothic and Old Gothic supplied. the aspect of
          Hidden Human Desires and the two-faced personallity of the world along with the taboo of the American Dream
          and fictional uncanny of curses and the great Beyond is what made Depths Curse by and some other the ideas
          such as Still Grass, Corpse Celebration, The Blacklight Phenomenon and White Picket Fence; along with others
          i dumped out or many more ideas in the future. we love this topic of gothic and find it to be a important to
          life due to it expressing somewhat of the messed up truth to life that some people are better off know
          rather then finding out the bad way. </p>
